            <p style="text-indent:2em;">The evolution towards Industry 5.0 is driven by intelligent, autonomous, and
                collaborative industrial
                systems. At the core of this transformation lies the challenge of enabling seamless collaboration not
                just within a single factory but across entire multi-enterprise ecosystems. This requires moving beyond
                siloed platforms towards open, service-oriented architectures.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;">This workshop focuses on the critical role of Service-Oriented Computing (SOC)
                in realizing
                industrial-scale intelligence and collaboration. We aim to explore the foundational models, methods, and
                technologies for building dynamic and trustworthy industrial service ecosystems. We invite high-quality
                contributions in areas including, but not limited to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service-Oriented Models for Enterprise Collaboration:</strong> Modeling, choreography,
                        and
                        orchestration of cross-organizational business processes and value chains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trusted Data Sharing Services: </strong>Architectures and governance for
                        Data-as-a-Service
                        (DaaS), data sovereignty, and secure data sharing in industrial ecosystems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intelligent Agents in Industry:</strong> Design and application of intelligent
                        agents-as-a-service for negotiation, planning, and autonomous asset management.</li>

                        twins
                        with physical assets and processes through service interfaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge-Cloud Service Computing: </strong>Orchestration and management of services across
                        the
                        edge-cloud continuum for real-time industrial applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial Service Ecosystems:</strong> Frameworks for the discovery, composition, and
                        evolution of services in collaborative manufacturing networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop Service Systems: </strong>Integrating human expertise and
                        decision-making
                        into automated industrial service workflows.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;"> This workshop will provide a premier forum for researchers and practitioners to
                discuss the next generation of industrial systems, framed through the lens of service-oriented
                computing.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title2">Relevance to ICSOC</div>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;">This workshop is highly relevant to ICSOC as it directly applies core service
                computing principles to the demanding domain of industrial collaboration. The selected topics address
                the full service lifecycle, from the service-oriented modeling of cross-enterprise business processes to
                the composition and orchestration of services across the edge-cloud continuum.</p>
            <p style="text-indent:2em;">Concepts like Trusted Data Sharing as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) and Service-Based
                Digital Twins explore advanced service engineering for complex cyber-physical systems. Furthermore, by
                including Intelligent Agents as a Service and Human-in-the-Loop systems, the workshop bridges
                traditional service computing with modern AI-driven and socio-technical challenges. It provides a
                focused forum to advance the theory and practice of service engineering for creating resilient,
                intelligent, and collaborative industrial service ecosystems, a key frontier for the ICSOC community.

            <p>We anticipate attracting <strong>15-25 high-quality submissions</strong>. This estimate is based on the
                following factors:</p>
            <p>-The satellite events for recent ICSOC conferences, such as ICSOC 2024 which received 109 submissions
                across its 10 workshops, show a healthy interest in specialized topics. This establishes a solid
                baseline average of around 10-11 submissions per workshop.</p>
            <p>-Our workshop's focus on Industrial Intelligence, Multi-Enterprise Collaboration, and Trusted Data
                Spaces is at the intersection of several high-impact research areas, including Industry 4.0/5.0,
                AI-driven services, and digital twins. The novelty and industrial importance of these themes are
